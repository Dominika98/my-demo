# my-demo
Code created by me (Dominika Kubicz) during my studies at VIA University Collage (2017-2021).

The repository consists of two projects:
- bachelor project (uses external libraries not included in this repository)
- small drivers created for Hardware Oriented Programming subject

The code written in these examples is created fully by me, no other group members or teachers contributed.
