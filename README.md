# my-demo
Code created by me (Dominika Kubicz) during my studies at VIA University Collage (2017-2021).

The repository consists of two projects:
- bachelor project (uses Arduino 2560 with an external module mounted on top)
- Thermomether application created for Arduino 2560 as a part of Hardware Oriented Programming Course
