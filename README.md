# my-demo
Code created by me (Dominika Kubicz) during my studies at VIA University Collage (2017-2021).

The repository consists of two projects:
- bachelor project (uses external libraries not included in this repository)
- Thermomether application created for Arduino 2560 as a part of Hardware Oriented Programming Course
    - All drivers used in this project are also implemented by me, no external code was used

The code written in these examples is created fully by me, no other group members or teachers contributed.
